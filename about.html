            <p>I've been building computers for more than 15 years and worked at Geek Squad for 4 years. Have experience repairing Windows, MacOS, and iPhones. I also took courses in Linux System Administration. I mess around with linux; I have a Proxmox virtual machine home lab, running a plex server, NAS, and various Linux distros.</p>
            <p>I like to break my raspberry pi. I've been dabbling with Python. I've made numerous scripts to automate processes at work and provide solutions for clients.</p>
            <p>I'm the father of a beautiful 15 month old girl. She's my favorite person. When I'm not changing diapers and coding, I moonlight as a Dungeons and Dragons Game Master, and I enjoy getting beat up at Victory MMA Fitness Gym in San Diego.</p>
            <p>I'm interested in psychology, philosophy, and rap music.</p>
            <p>Ever since I built my first computer when I was fifteen, I've been drawn to learn everything about how they work. After years of repairing and modifying desktops, laptops, and cellphones, I was bit by the programming bug and now I can't stop!
               As an avid learner, I love the intellectual challenge that web development provides. I'm the father of a beautiful 15 month old girl. She's my favorite person. When I'm not changing diapers or breaking my Raspberry Pi, I moonlight as a Dungeons and Dragons Game Master and I enjoy getting beat up at my local MMA Gym.
               Besides long walks on the beach, I'm interested in psychology, philosophy, and rap music.
